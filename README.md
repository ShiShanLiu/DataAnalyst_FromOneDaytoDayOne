This is to demonstrate common machine learning algorithms in Python, which also serves as a note for myself.

One day I will utilize this knowledge to land a job in the data analyst field.

Maybe I'm not perfect right now, but I will be one day.

One day to become a data analyst and today is DAY ONE.

Stay Tuned!
