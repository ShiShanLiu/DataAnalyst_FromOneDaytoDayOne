This is to demonstrate common machine learning algorithms in Python, which also serves as a note for myself.

Doing this is not just for finding a job, but also for me to learn how to analyze real-world data and explain its meanings for real things.

I've always been convinced that **DATA can tell us unknown stories**. Thus, learning how to explore data is the first step.

One day I will utilize this knowledge to land a job in the **data analyst** field.

Maybe I'm not perfect right now, but I will be one day.

**From One Day to DAY ONE** to be a **data analyst**.

Stay Tuned!
