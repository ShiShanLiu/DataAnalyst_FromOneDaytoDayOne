This is to demonstrate common machine learning algorithms in Python, which also serves as a note for myself.

One day I will utilize this knowledge to land a job in the **data analyst** field.

Maybe I'm not perfect right now, but I will be one day.

**From One Day to DAY ONE** to be a **data analyst**.

Stay Tuned!
